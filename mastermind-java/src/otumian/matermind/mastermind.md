# mastermind board game implementation in Java

## Introduction

Python is a simple programming language that speeds up prototyping. What about Java? Let's code a mastermind in Java, rewriting or mimicking each line, from python to java.

You can have a look at the python version [here][python-mastermind]

## Implementation

### Import the _random_ module

```py
import random

```

This is similar to `Math.random()`. In python we would have done, `random.randint(x, y)` after we `import random`.

### The number of times to play must be even between 2 and 12 rounds

```py
while True:
    try:
        rounds = int(input("Enter number of rounds (Even): "))

        if rounds >= 2 and rounds <= 12 and rounds % 2 == 0:
            break

    except ValueError:
        print("Round must be an even number from 2 to 12 includes")

```

- `rounds = int(input("Enter number of rounds (Even): "))` is the same as taking an input and parsing it to an integer then assigning the value to `rounds`.
- In java we have to separate the prompt text from the "input" function or we can implement a method that behaves in the same manner. Let's do the former.
  - Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

```java

// The number of times to play must be even between 2 and 12 rounds
int rounds = 2;
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

while (true) {
    try {
        System.out.print("Enter number of rounds (Even in [2, 12]): ");
        rounds = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        if (rounds >= 2 && rounds <= 12 && rounds % 2 == 0) {
            break;
        }

    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Round must be an even number from 2 to 12 includes");
    }
}
```

### settings: should there be duplicates and blanks? Let's allow the user to enter _1_ for _true_ and _0_ for _false_. I don't think we'd need a blank since we are since numbers for the mastermind game. We will make it such that when the user enters a number that is not specified, we'd set the duplication to _0_.

```py
try:
    duplicates_allowed = int(input("Duplicates allowed? (1/0) "))
except ValueError:
    duplicates_allowed = 0

```

### The number of codes we will be dealing with will be four. So we will have four codes in the code breaker.

```py
NUMBER_CODE = 4

```

### The code maker is that which the user has to guess, with the code breaker. We will create the code maker taking into account the option, _duplicates_allowed_.

```py
code_maker = []
counter = 0

while counter < NUMBER_CODE:
    code = random.randint(0, 9)

    if duplicates_allowed:
        code_maker.append(code)
        counter += 1

    else:
        if not code in code_maker:
            code_maker.append(code)
            counter += 1
```

### Since this is a game, it must prove challenging but not too challenging as such we have to provide the user with some hints. we will hint the user if they are close to the code. Let `[0, 0, 0, 0]` represents each code and if the code breaker is greater than the code maker, hint _1_, hint _0_ when equal else _-1_.

```py
hints = ['h', 'i', 'n', 't']

```

### Now we can take in the user's guess, which is the code breaker. The user will be playing our mastermind, where the user guesses the code maker. The game terminates when the number of rounds is exhausted or the code breaker matches the code maker, in this case, all the hints will `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

```py
# code breaker guesses the code by the code maker
while rounds > 0:

    # enter guess with spaces
    code_breaker = list(map(int, input("Enter codes space separated: ").split()))

    # compare the code_breaker to the code maker
    for i in range(NUMBER_CODE):
        if code_breaker[i] > code_maker[i]:
            hints[i] = 1
        elif code_breaker[i] == code_maker[i]:
            hints[i] = 0
        else:
            hints[i] = -1

    # because of the values that we used to hint the user
    # we have to find some dicey way to break the program
    # when the user guesses the code (all hints go to 0)
    if hints.count(0) == 4:
        break

    print(hints)

    rounds -= 1
```

### we now decide who won the game base on the number

```py
if rounds > 0:
    print("You won the rounds")
else:
    print("You lost bitterly to a computer")

print(code_maker)
```

### Final snippet

```py
# app.py

# Import the _random_ module
import random

# The number of times to play must be even between 2 to 12 rounds
while True:
    try:
        rounds = int(input("Enter number of rounds (Even in [2, 12]): "))

        if rounds >= 2 and rounds <= 12 and rounds % 2 == 0:
            break

    except ValueError:
        print("Round must be an even number from 2 to 12 includes")


# should there be duplicates
try:
    duplicates_allowed = int(input("Duplicates allowed? (1/0) "))
except ValueError:
    duplicates_allowed = 0


# The number of codes we will be dealing with will four
NUMBER_CODE = 4


# The code maker
code_maker = []
counter = 0

while counter < NUMBER_CODE:
    code = random.randint(0, 9)

    if duplicates_allowed:
        code_maker.append(code)
        counter += 1

    else:
        if not code in code_maker:
            code_maker.append(code)
            counter += 1


# hint
hints = ['h', 'i', 'n', 't']


# code breaker guesses the code by the code maker
while rounds > 0:

    # enter guess with spaces
    code_breaker = list(map(int, input("Enter codes space separated: ").split()))

    # compare the code_breaker to the code maker
    for i in range(NUMBER_CODE):
        if code_breaker[i] > code_maker[i]:
            hints[i] = 1
        elif code_breaker[i] == code_maker[i]:
            hints[i] = 0
        else:
            hints[i] = -1

    # because of the values that we used to hint the user
    # we have to find some dicey way to break the program
    # when the user guesses the code (all hints go to 0)
    if hints.count(0) == 4:
        break

    print(hints)

    rounds -= 1


# declaring the result of the game
if rounds > 0:
    print("You won the rounds")
else:
    print("You lost bitterly to a computer")

print(code_maker)

```

## Let's show off a little

We will create functions and constants where possible. I remember doing something like this once, and I later went back to the old code because I could find where I was - I was lost in my code. It happens. Sometimes it is not the best, and sometimes it is. I am interested in showing you another possibility.

```py
# app2.py

# Import the _random_ module

import os
from time import sleep


# string constants
ROUNDS_PROMPT = "Enter number of rounds (Even in [2, 12]) ü§óÔ∏è: "
INVALID_ROUNDS_PROMPT = "Round must be an even number from 2 to 12 includes üò©Ô∏è"
DUPLICATE_PROMPT = "Duplicates allowed? (1/0) ü§§Ô∏è: "
CODE_BREAKER_PROMPT = "Enter codes separated by space: "
WIN_PROMPT = "You won the rounds üëèÔ∏è"
LOSS_PROMPT = "You lost bitterly to a computer üòèÔ∏è"

# int constants
ZERO, ONE = 0, 1
NUMBER_CODE = 4
TERMINATING_VALUE = 0
MORE, EQUAL, LESS = 1, 0, -1
MIN_ROUNDS, MAX_ROUNDS = 2, 12
RAND_INT_MIN, RAND_INT_MAX = 0, 9
WAITING_TIME = 3

# The code maker
code_maker = []

# hint
hints = ['h', 'i', 'n', 't']

def clear_screen() :
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')

# validates the round input
def isvalid_round(rounds):
    return MIN_ROUNDS <= rounds <= MAX_ROUNDS and rounds % 2 == ZERO


# declaring the result of the game
def declare_result(rounds):
    if rounds > TERMINATING_VALUE:
        print(WIN_PROMPT)
    else:
        print(LOSS_PROMPT)


# generate code maker
def generate_code_maker(duplicates_allowed):
    counter = 0

    while counter < NUMBER_CODE:
        code = random.randint(RAND_INT_MIN, RAND_INT_MAX)

        if duplicates_allowed:
            code_maker.append(code)
            counter += ONE

        else:
            if not code in code_maker:
                code_maker.append(code)
                counter += ONE


# compare the code_breaker to the code maker

    # enter guess with spaces
    code_breaker = list(map(int, input(CODE_BREAKER_PROMPT).split()))

    for pos in range(NUMBER_CODE):
        if code_breaker[pos] > code_maker[pos]:
            hints[pos] = MORE
        elif code_breaker[pos] == code_maker[pos]:
            hints[pos] = EQUAL
        else:
            hints[pos] = LESS


# entry point
def src.otumian.matermind.App():
    # The number of times to play must be even between 2 to 12 rounds
    while True:
        try:
            rounds = int(input(ROUNDS_PROMPT))

            if isvalid_round(rounds):
                break

        except ValueError:

        # when the user guesses the code (all hints go to 0)
        if hints.count(EQUAL) == NUMBER_CODE:
            break

        print(hints)

        rounds -= ONE


    declare_result(rounds)

    print(code_maker)


# infinitely keep playing
while True:
    src.otumian.matermind.App()

    sleep(WAITING_TIME)
    clear_screen()

    # reset the game for replay
    code_maker = []
    hints = ['h', 'i', 'n', 't']
