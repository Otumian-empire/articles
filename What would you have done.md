# What would you have done?

## About me

Hi, my name is Otu Michael and a backend developer. I have been advised to say that I am a backend engineer but I do not mind. Anyway, While I was in school, I had to interview for a parttime job as a programming tutor - Introducing a group of Higher primary and junior high school kids to computer programming using the python programming language.

I decided to put together my own material from experience and also other tutorials and python documentation.

## Materials

Well, this is a link to the material and its accompanying practicals. You may check it out and give me your feedback and critics. I am still working on it though.

- [swift-python]
- [swift-python-practicals]

## Concerns and legality

Now my concerns:

- How to publish it
- Where to publish it (I was considering GitHub and making it open-source)
- Should it be sold (I really hope not but monetize videos on youtube)

Bear in mind that I have seen a lot of books hosted/published on GitHub and that was what I intended but eventually got confused when I read the [README.md of ydkjs] then [README.md of understandinges6].
