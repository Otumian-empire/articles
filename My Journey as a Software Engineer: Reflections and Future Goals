# My Journey as a Software Engineer: Reflections and Future Goals

## Introduction

I am back! It has been 244 days since my last post on August 26, 2022. A lot has happened in the past few months, including school, work, and new experiences. In this post, I want to share some reflections on my work experience and my plans for the future.

## Work

I have had the opportunity to work with some great engineers and learn a lot about different programming languages, development methodologies, and company cultures. I have also learned how to work with different people and how to manage my time. Recently, I was part of a team that developed a new feature for an online shopping platform, which was a challenging but rewarding experience.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced was working with a massive code base for the first time. It was overwhelming to try to figure out where everything was and how everything worked. But I was able to get up to speed quickly and learn a lot in the process. Another challenge was dealing with a difficult team member, but I learned how to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts in a professional manner.

## Accomplishments

I am proud of the work I have done at the three fintech companies where I have interned and worked full-time. I have learned a lot and grown as a software engineer. I am also excited to start learning C#/dotnet and move out of my comfort zone. In addition, I received positive feedback from my supervisor on my recent project and was recognized as a valuable contributor to the team.

## Future Goals

Looking ahead, I want to continue developing my skills as a software engineer and exploring new technologies. I plan to take online courses and attend workshops to improve my knowledge of C#/dotnet and other programming languages. I also want to work on more challenging projects and contribute to open-source projects in my spare time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my work experience has been a valuable learning opportunity, and I am grateful for the support and guidance of my colleagues and supervisors. I am excited about the future and look forward to continuing to grow and contribute as a software engineer. Thank you for reading!
